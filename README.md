### **Experience**

#### **Senior Software Engineer**
**Dell**  
*Dec 2022 – Present*  
- Dell Remediation Scripts - Worked on scripts that tackled following problems like Thermal, BSOD, No Audio scenarios, Thermal events and many more.
- Dell Chrome Telemetry - Worked on project where data from Dell chrome devices was collected and parsed on the backend.
- Enhancing Customer Experience - A project aimed at improving the customer experience by collecting and analyzing diagnostic data from laptops and sending it to the cloud, where it can be used to predict potential problems using Artificial Intelligence.

#### **Software Engineer**
**Stryker**  
*Jul 2019 – Oct 2022*  
- Extracting Meaningful Data from the Cloud - This project required the maintenance and development of cloud data parsers that extracted meaningful information from raw data uploaded by devices. For teams that wanted to use the solution on their devices, it was necessary to comprehend the data and create new data parsers. Because this project was used by internal teams to improve their workflows, it had an indirect but significant impact on the company.
- Improving the Security of Medical Devices - The project was to improve the security of the medical devices as well as the software solution that connected them to the cloud. To accomplish this, extensive research on cryptography, public key infrastructure, and certificates was carried out. I was able to implement a super secure licensing system for the devices after investing 3+ years in it, including designing the solution from scratch to company-wide deployment. This solution reduced the number of cyberattacks by 90% and saved the company a significant amount of money.
- Streamlining Operating Theater Workflows - Interconnected devices in an operating theater to make it easier for doctors to use. Understanding of low-level protocols was developed to allow devices to communicate wirelessly with one another and be controlled by a single master device. The financial impact of this project was minor, but it improved doctors' workflow by allowing them to view results from multiple devices on a single screen.
- Reprogramming RFID Tags for Medical Devices - A software solution for reprogramming RFID tags for medical devices was developed in a short but impactful project. The data for these tags was managed in a backend SQL server and reprogrammed after the devices were sanitized for reuse. This solution not only saved the company money but also contributed to the company's sustainability efforts by reducing medical waste.

#### **Intern**
**Stryker**  
*Jun 2018 – Jun 2019*  
- Strengthening Medical Device Connectivity - Tasked with enhancing a software solution that connected medical devices to the cloud and transmitted telemetric data which was limited in its functionality. I worked on improving the solution by adding features like the ability to download updates and make remote procedure calls. This upgrade had a significant impact on the company because it eliminated the need for sales representatives to physically visit hospitals to update the software, resulting in significant cost savings.

#### **Intern**
**National Physical Laboratory**  
*Jan 2017 – Jun 2017*  
- Well National Physical Laboratory is a single institute in India where the 7 SI Units are maintained. I worked in Optical Radiation Metrology Department, where I was assigned to repair Goniophotometer (which is in simple language is a 360-degree light measurement device) which was used to calibrate light sources of major light manufacturers in India. Unfortunately, its motherboard was burned out. To repair this I mapped all the connection to a NI card and controlled all the mechanical movements and measurements using NI programming back then. And increased the overall accuracy as well.

### **Education**

- **Master of Engineering** in Electronics Instrumentation and Control  
  *Thapar University (2017 – 2019)* | GPA: 7.23  
  - This was a project-based Masters Degree, where almost I spent my second year working at Stryker. I did participate in some activities, but this time I was more focused on learning real-world skills.

- **Bachelor of Engineering** in Electronics Instrumentation and Control  
  *Thapar University (2013 – 2017)* | GPA: 7.97  
  - During my days at my college, I was actively working in multiple societies, where I gained soft skills like public speaking, event management, people management, marketing, and finance. Towards the end of my degree, I took the responsibility as President of hosting a 5-day cultural fest. All this might not make sense in software development, but my past might give an idea about my personality.
